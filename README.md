# Code for INF 581 Project

Here you may find our implementation of all models we investigated in the report. The code is split into Jupiter Notebooks for each model. All notebooks are divided into several parts by markdown markers or comments for better comprehension. One needs to follow what is written inside each notebook in order to understand an implementation of certain model.
